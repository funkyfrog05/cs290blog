  <h2>Assignment 1 Reflection - October 15, 2025</h2>
  <p>
    Completing this assignment helped me get familiar with using Git, GitHub, and writing basic HTML. I didn’t run into too many issues, but figuring out how to publish using ENGR web space was a bit tricky at first.
  </p>
  <p>
    I learned how to structure a simple HTML page using headings, paragraphs, and lists. I also practiced using Git commands like `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`, which reinforced my understanding of version control.
  </p>
  <p>
    The most helpful resource was the assignment description itself and some of the guides on the Ed Discussion forum.

  <h2>Assignment 2 – CSS Styling and Page Matching</h2>
  <p class="blog-date">October 29, 2025</p>

  <p>
    This assignment focused on applying CSS to style an unformatted HTML page so that it matched a set of provided mockups. 
    The main challenge was ensuring that the visual layout of every element matched the mock images as closely as possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the most challenging parts of the project was achieving a responsive grid layout for the post listings that still maintained even 
    spacing and consistent image sizing.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also learned a lot about font management and subtle typography differences. The assignment required using both Roboto and Roboto Slab 
    with distinct weights to visually separate the header from the rest of the text. Matching those weights to the mocks required careful use 
    of the <code>font-weight</code> property and confirming that the correct weights were being imported from Google Fonts.
  </p>

  <p>
    The most helpful resources during this assignment were the MDN CSS documentation and W3Schools. I also referred to class lectures on 
    the box model and CSS positioning, which helped clarify how to manage padding and layout structure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some specific things I had to Google included “how to make a fixed circular button grow from the center on hover” and “CSS grid 
    equal spacing for responsive cards.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, this assignment reinforced how much precision and iteration go into front-end development. I also gained 
    confidence in using transitions, hover states, and responsive CSS techniques to make pages feel interactive and polished.
