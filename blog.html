  <h2>Assignment 1 Reflection - October 15, 2025</h2>
  <p>
    Completing this assignment helped me get familiar with using Git, GitHub, and writing basic HTML. I didnâ€™t run into too many issues, but figuring out how to publish using ENGR web space was a bit tricky at first.
  </p>
  <p>
    I learned how to structure a simple HTML page using headings, paragraphs, and lists. I also practiced using Git commands like `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`, which reinforced my understanding of version control.
  </p>
  <p>
    The most helpful resource was the assignment description itself and some of the guides on the Ed Discussion forum.
